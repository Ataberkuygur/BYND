# BYND

## Overview
BYND is an innovative productivity app that redefines personal goal management through the lens of identity, emotion, and cutting-edge voice-AI technology. It transforms a traditional task manager into an emotionally intelligent experience by allowing users to communicate with a personalized AI assistant ("Future Self") via natural speech. The assistant, powered by advanced voice cloning and AI models, speaks back in the user's own voice, fostering accountability and motivation.

## Core Features
### Voice-First Task Management
- Users speak their tasks, edits, and deletions.
- The AI interprets natural language to create structured goals and reminders.
- No typing, menus, or manual scheduling is required.

### Calendar and Integration

- Integration with Google Calendar and other tools via OAuth.
- Real-time syncing of tasks across calendars.

### Self Chat Experience
- Enables communication between the user, their "past self," and their "future self" for reflection and guidance.
- "Future Self" provides wise guidance, reflections, and proactive task suggestions.

### Voice Cloning with ElevenLabs
- During onboarding, users provide a 1-2 minute audio sample.

## Development
This repository now includes a small Node.js HTTP API with file-backed task storage.

### Run the server
```bash
npm start
```
The server listens on port 3000 by default and stores data in `tasks.json`. Visit
`http://localhost:3000` in your browser for a minimal interface to manage tasks.

### Available endpoints
- `GET /tasks` – list tasks
- `GET /tasks/:id` – fetch a single task
- `POST /tasks` – create a task with `{ "title": "..." }`
- `POST /tasks/:id/complete` – mark a task complete
- `PATCH /tasks/:id` – update a task's `title` or `completed` state
- `DELETE /tasks/:id` – remove a task

### Run tests
```bash
npm test
```
